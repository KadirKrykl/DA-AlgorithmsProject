# Heap vs Set For Finding Elements

### Heap
In the heap data structure, the root node is compared with its children and arranged according to the order. So if a is a root node and b is its child, then the property, **key (a)>= key (b)** will generate a max heap.

### Set
A set is a data structure that can store any number of unique values in any order you so wish. Setâ€™s are different from arrays in the sense that they only allow non-repeated, unique values within them.

## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to compare how quickly an element can be found in set or heap data structures.

## Workflow
Firstly, we chose to use Java because it has its own Set class, on the other hand we generated our heap class for java heap implementation. The heap class will work with the help of an array list.

Afterwards, we read our data from text files and started searching for the elements entered from the terminal.
